##Step 2: Essay Questions
###1. Why are you interested in programming? What have you done to expose yourself to programming so far?

For the past five years, I have supported my husband in his culinary career. In 2012, he quit his job to pursue his dream of one day becoming a Head Chef and since then we have traveled from Vancouver to Miami to Chicago with Earls Kitchen and Bar as he was promoted. Last March he achieved his dream after being with the company for 4 years when he was appointed Head Chef of Earls Kitchen and Bar in Bellevue.

Witnessing him take on the challenge of entering a new career field later in life, with no previous experience, has given me inspiration for my own career. I have seen firsthand that if someone has a vision for themselves, and they arduously apply themselves towards their goal, they will be successful. Our only limitation is ourselves.

In preparation, I have begun doing self-paced coding courses online such as Code Academy, Udemy, CodeCombat as well as the Jump Start with Ada. The logic and detail required I find highly appealing as I have always found myself to be very logically minded.

I have no doubt that the Ada program will be rigorous, and I am determined to succeed in creating a future for myself that would not otherwise exist. I would be honored to be accepted into the Ada Developers Academy, and will go above and beyond to prove myself a worthy student, ambassador and alumni.

###2. If you are accepted into our program, where do you see your career in 5 years?

In 5 years, I intend to be a senior game engineer with an AAA game developer.

I have had a passion for video games since I was 7 years old. At seven yeras old I saved my allowance up for six months to buy a Nintendo . I have played both console and PC games ever since. My goal is to pursue a career in video game development, as there is a sever lack of women in the industry, and I am passionate about making games more inclusive and accessible for all under-represented minorities.

That being said, I would also like to keep an open mind throughout the Ada program in regards to where I would like to focus my career. Perhaps UI/UX design will captivate me, or database managment. Regardless of where the future takes me, I am confident that the development skills I learn at Ada will have an invaluable impact on my future success.

It is my mission to be an inspiration, role model and positive force for women and minorities in the technology sector, and I know that Ada could be a valuable part of that.


###3. After reading Ada's Vision, Mission and Inclusivity Statement, how will you contribute to Ada's vision for an inclusive and diverse community?

I intend to be a mentor and role model to younger generations who wish to pursue a career in video game development, or any technology related field. Only by taking on the roles we wish to see more women doing, will we slowly begin to see the change needed in tech industries. With women holding a shockingly low percentage of senior management roles across all industries, I firmly believe it is up to us as individuals and as a collective to step up and forge a new path for women in technology. I intend to be one of those women.

####4. Tell us about a time you made a mistake that you learned a lot from. If you encountered the situation again, what would you do differently?

I consider my maturity and experience to be a great asset in my success both during and post the Ada Developers Academy. During my 10+ years in the workforce I have made numerous mistakes, but consider each of them to be a learning opportunity. I have matured and gained valuable insight which allows me to progress more quickly when taking on new challenges.

One of the most valuable lessons I learn was during my time with Earls Kitchen and Bar. I was responsible for all administrative tasks during new restaurant openings, from new hire documents and government forms to benefits administration as well as payroll for 200+ new employees. To say restaurant openings can be chaotic would be an understatement. During my first opening in Miami I became overwhelmed with the amount of paperwork and organization required, and failed to properly escalate payroll discrepancies that employees brought to my attention. As they were not receiving timely responses to their questions they brought this up with my manager. I am glad that they did. Although it was a painful lesson to learn, and I felt horrible for having failed to support them as I wanted to, it has been one of the most poignant lessons of my professional career.

Our General Manager Justin sat me down after receiving payroll questions and asked me about my process and organization with regards to my email. Embarrassed, I opened it and showed him the backlog of communication and disorganization that was within. Instead of berating me he proceeded to show me his method of organization and coached me on how I could more efficiently perform my job and achieve greater success. His rule was to never have more than 10 emails in his inbox, and it is a rule I have personally adopted to this day.

Earls lives by numerous mottos, but the one which stuck with me the most was "Do everything with Integrity".

_Integrity. (noun) 1. the quality of being honest and having strong moral principles; moral uprightness._

That isn't to say that I am not or was not an honest person. But when you stay to a co-worker that you will have an answer to them by the end of the day, and you do not, you are now out of integrity, and must take immediate action to re-establish said integrity or else risk damaging your personal and professional relationship.

I believe that this is the most important quality any person or employee can have.

It makes life simple. It creates trust. It relieves stress.

I strive to live each day in integrity and encourage all those around me to do the same.
