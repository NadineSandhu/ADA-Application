##Phase 1 Ada Application for Nadine Sandhu

###Step 2: Essay Questions
####1. Why are you interested in programming? What have you done to expose yourself to programming so far?

For the past five years I have supported my husband as he pursues his culinary career. In 2012 I encouraged him to quit his job and pusruse something he was truly passionate about, regardless of the immediate outcome. We have moved from Vancouver to Miami to Chicago and finally Seattle as he purused his goal. Last March he became the 3rd fastest promoted Head Chef with Earls Kitchen and Bar.

Watching him apply himself with no experience in a new field as he turned 30 gave me inspiration for my own career development. I firmly believe that if someoen applies themeslves towards a greater future without personal or emotional baggage they will achieve success. Our only limitation is ourselves.

I have no doubt that the Ada program will be rigorous and exhausting. I am determined to succeed in creating a future for myself that wouldn't  exist otherwise. I would be honored to be accepted to the Ada program, and will go above and beyond to become a worthy student, ambassador and alumni.

I have begun doing self paced coding courses online; CodeAcademy, Udemy as well as the Jump Start with Ada. The logic and detail required I find higly appealing as I find myself quite logically minded. I love data entry and tasks requiring going over details witha fine tooth comb so to speak.

####2. If you are accepted into our program, where do you see your career in 5 years?

In 5 years I intend to be a senior game engineer with an AAA game developer.

I have had a passion for video games since I was 7 years old. Saving up my allowance for six months in order to buy the first NES, I have played every consol available in some capacity. My goal is to pursue a career in video game development, as there is a sever lack of women in the industry, and I am passionate about making games more inclusive and accessible.

Ada would be the opportunity for me to gain the skills requited to transition careers later in life. I hope to be an inspiration, role model and positive force for equality in the video game industry. Bringin my passion for games and equality togther for my career would be a dream come true.


####3. After reading Ada's Vision, Mission and Inclusivity Statement, how will you contribute to Ada's vision for an inclusive and diverse community?

I intend to be a mentor and role model to younger generations who wish to pursue a career in video game development, or any technology related field. Only by putting ourselves in the roles we wish to see more people doing, will we slowly begin to see the change so desperately talked about in tech industries. With women  holding a shockingly low percentage of senior management roles across all companies, I firmly believe it is only with hard work and women such as myself stepping up to the challenege that we will see true change.

####4. Tell us about a time you made a mistake that you learned a lot from. If you encountered the situation again, what would you do differently?

I consider my age of 33 to be a great asset in my success both during and post the Ada Developers Academy. I have made numerous mistakes during my 10 + years in the workforce, but consider these experience not to be mistakes, but rather learning experience. I have matured and gained valuable personal insight which allow me to progress more quickly in new roles.

One of the most valuable lessons I learn was during my time with Earls Kitchen and Bar. I was responsible for all administrative tasks during new restaurant openings, from new hire documents and government forms to benefits administration as well as payroll for 200+ new employees. To say restaurant openings can be chaotic would be an understatement. During my first opening in Miami I became overwhelmed with the amount of paperwork and organization required and failed to properly escallate payroll discrepancies that employees brought to my attention. As they were not receiving timely responses to their questions they escallated the issue to my managers. I am glad they did. Although it was a painful lesson to learn, and I felt horrible for having failed to support them as I wanted to, it has been one of the most poingnant lessons of my professional career.

Our General Manager Justin sat me down after receiving payroll questions and showed me his email. He had less than 10 items in his inbox. He asked me to open my own. Embarassed, I opened it and showed him the backlog of communication and disorganization that was within. Instead of berrating me he proceded to show me his method of organzation and coached me on what I knew I was already lacking, but faild to have the words for.

_Integrity. (noun) 1. the quality of being honest and having strong moral principles; moral uprightness._

That isn't to say that I am not or was not an honest person. But when you stay to a co-worker that you will have an answer to them by the end of the day, and you do not, you are now out of integrity, and must take action to re-establish said integrity or else risk damaging your personal and professional relationship.

I believe that the most important quality in any person or employee can have is integrity. As soon as you realize you are or will be out of integrity you must do everything in your power to get it back again.

It makes life simple. It creates trust. It relieves stress.

I strive to live each day in integrity and encourage all those around me to do the same.

I pledge to live each day in integrity and dedication during my time with Ada Developers Academy and beyond.
